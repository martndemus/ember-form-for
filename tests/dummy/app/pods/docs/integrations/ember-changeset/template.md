# ember-changeset

Ember Form For suppport
[ember-changeset](https://github.com/DockYard/ember-changeset) and
[ember-changeset-validations](https://github.com/DockYard/ember-changeset-validations/).

## Config

Ember Form For just need a little bit of config to be able to use the errors generated by ember-changeset. To do so add the followin lines in your `config/environment.js` file:

```js
module.exports = function(environment) {
  var ENV = {
    'ember-form-for': {
      errorsPath: 'error.PROPERTY_NAME.validation',
    }
  };

  return ENV;
};
```

This is because ember-changeset stores it's errors on the `error.PROPERTY_NAME.validation` property,
while Ember Form For expects them (by default) to be on the `errors` property.

_For those still using the old configuration of setting `errorsProperty`, this method will still work.
However, if both are defined then `errorsPath` will take precedence._

## Usage

When it's done you can simply pass a changeset into the `{{form-for}}` helper instead of the raw object:

```hbs
{{#form-for (changeset model validations) as |f|}}
  {{! form fields }}
{{/form-for}}
```
