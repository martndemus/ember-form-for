# ember-changeset

It's easy to integrate
[ember-changeset](https://github.com/DockYard/ember-changeset) and
[ember-changeset-validations](https://github.com/DockYard/ember-changeset-validations/)
with Ember Form For. All you have to do is to pass the changeset into the
`{{form-for}}` helper instead of the raw object:

```hbs
{{#form-for (changeset model validations) as |f|}}
  {{! form fields }}
{{/form-for}}
```

## Errors

To be able to use the errors generated by ember-changeset you need to configure
the following thing in your `config/environment.js` file:

```js
module.exports = function(environment) {
  var ENV = {
    'ember-form-for': {
      errorsPath: 'error.PROPERTY_NAME.validation',
    }
  };

  return ENV;
};
```

This is because ember-changeset stores it's errors on the `error.PROPERTY_NAME.validation` property,
while Ember Form For expects them (by default) to be on the `errors` property.

For those still using the old configuration of setting `errorsProperty`, this method will still work.
However, if both are defined then `errorsPath` will take precedence.
